## About

Product-driven engineer focused on designing and shipping real-world software across mobile platforms, backend architecture, AI integrations, and emerging blockchain systems.

I care deeply about **product feel**, **scalability**, and **developer experience** — building tools that are both technically sophisticated and intuitively usable.

**Focus Areas**

- Native iOS application development  
- Backend systems & real-time architecture  
- AI agent orchestration & integrations  
- Applied blockchain infrastructure

## Selected Projects

### Clawr  
The first iOS application for OpenClaw — enabling users to create, import, and manage autonomous AI agents directly from mobile.

Focus: agent UX, mobile orchestration, secure identity, real-time task flows

---

### Hashtag  
AI-powered knowledge workflow platform designed for structured LLM automation and persistent context systems.

Focus: memory systems, workflow orchestration, knowledge graphs

---

### Chess AI  
Python-based chess engine implementing minimax strategy logic and evaluation heuristics.

Focus: algorithm design, decision trees, performance optimization

## Philosophy

I’m interested in the shift toward **agent-driven software** — where autonomous systems collaborate with humans to execute work, not just assist with it.

My work explores:

- Mobile interfaces for autonomous agents  
- Trust & identity in agent ecosystems  
- Human-AI collaboration patterns  
- Scalable infrastructure for persistent intelligence
